TablePaste lets you copy comma delimited data to the clipboard and paste it as a styled HTML table.

I would often want to paste that data in an email, but the only way I was aware of to get that tab delimited data in a formatted table was to paste it to Excel, copy it again then paste it in the email.  At the time I could only run Excel by running it in my Windows virtual machine, so it was very inconvenient.

When the TablePaste paste hotkey is pressed, it takes tab delimited data from the clipboard, replaces it with a styled HTML table, then performs the paste operation.
